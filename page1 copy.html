                    This is a pretty basic and quick part because for people that are using MSVSCODE all you have to do is press ! And then enter.
                 For people that are using something else just look down. This is all you have to do but I will teach you what all these codes mean in part 1.

                    Part 1:  What are html tags and what do they do
                </h2>
                <div class="container" id="container2">
                    <h4>What are tags and how do they work in html? 
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                    
                    Tags in HTML are premade programs that define what you are trying to do. Tags are how you change your website and make it have or do things.
                     Tags can do drastic things and make a website itself. An example is how tags are the main ways to communicate using words.
                      There are many tags in HTML letting you do almost anything you can think of if you know how they work.
                     In this part we are only going to go over the basic tags but in later sections we will be using a vast array of tags so make sure you understand what they do and how they work. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        How do tags work? 
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                    Tags in HTML are simple and only have a few rules. HTML tags consist of a opening command which opens a program. 
                    The command which has the program do the action you are commanding it to do program ... And the closing command which signals the end of a piece of code .
                     once you have made that, than you are going to write what you want to do. For example if it was a paragraph then you would write your paragraph. 
                      After you finish writing, all you must do is write the opening tag but add a slash.
                       Those are the basic rules that I will be teaching for right now but it does get more complicated so be ready.

                <h2>

                    </h4>
                <p>
                In this part we are going to be going over 6 tags. The first one being- 
                </p>
                <h5>
                    <h5>

                        The HTML tags
                        </h5>
                    <p>
                    The HTML tags are usually premade, and they are very simple. All they do is compile all of the programs you are making into one tag to make them work together.
                     All you must do is put all your code into this tag so that they all work accordingly. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                    The Head tags 
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                    The Head tags are also usually a premade tag in a coding software, and it is one of 2 main sections in the HTML tag to put code in.
                     This tag is not as important for websites, but you can do some styling for your website using this tag.
                      The head tags are used to store data and is many used for things like logins or search engines to store
                       what it knows for the user experience to do things like login or find information on a search engine. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                    The Body tags 
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                    The Body tags are the second main sections in the HTML tag to put your code in.
                     This tag is used much more than the head tags and it is used to input information and put it onto the web page.
                      The body tags are very diverse and are used to do things like write,
                       format and style your web page with various different sub sections on this main section 
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                    The p tags 
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                    The p tags stand for paragraph tags, and they do just that. The p tags are very straightforward,
                     being how all they do is allow you to type full paragraphs to display on your web page. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                    The h1 to h6 tags 
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                    The h1 to h6 tags are used to display titles and headings in a web page. 
                    The h1 to h6 tags are used by having the h1 tag being the biggest font size and it gradually goes all the way down to h6 which is the smallest font size. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                    The hr and br tags 
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                    The hr and br tags are used to indicate line break. These tags are meant to be placed in between the paragraphs that you want to have separate.
                     These tags are also different from the others because instead of you having to use an opening and closing tag for it to operate.
                      These tags only use the opening tag to display the line breaks. 
                      The differences between a hr and br tag is that the br tag is just a blank space and the hr tag adds a line to fill up that space but otherwise they are very similar. 
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>
                    This is the end of this section and I know this is a tricky one so if needed read over it a few times to get a good grasp of the concept but once you are ready move on the section 3.
